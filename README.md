- Hi, I’m @JahBrowne

- I’m interested in developing unique and handy systems.
  
- My interest in programming grew from watching game development documentaries and videos. I was stupefied by the complexity and creativity needed to develop a game.

-  I’m currently trying to increase my skills in C++ and C#.
