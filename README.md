- Hi, I’m @JahBrowne

- I’m interested in developing unique and handy systems.
  
- My interest in programming grew from watching game development documentaries and videos. I was stupefied by the complexity and creativity needed to develop a game. But the most impactful thing that made me set out directly into programming was the scene showing the E.D.I.T.H glasses from Spider-Man: Far From Home. That scene shock me when I was finding out what I wanted to do in the future. The concept behind the glasses made me research into how to develop glasses like that which at the time confused me. From that point I decided to get into programming and dab my hands into some programming languages such as C# and Java.

-  I’m currently trying to increase my skills in Java, C++ and C#.
